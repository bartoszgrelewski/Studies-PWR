# Descripction of the faculty's course "Programming" 

## This course was learning us Java programming language and a bit C++. The best projects were the last two. 

### Lists:
* `Lista 4` - Java implementation of Paint program. There were creating a new shapes, moving, resizing, changing color, saving and loading from file implemented in.  
* `Lista 5` - Implementation of symulation of randomity. It was like square `n x m` with random `p` and speed of working `k`. And the squares inside this square were changing their color randomly. It was simple symulation of randomity in which we used threads. It was all about to learn how to use threads in Java.  
* `Lista 6` - Implementation of Binary Tree with generic types such as Integer, Double and String. It also had to be implemented in a way using `server-client` architecture. I wrote commands as `search`, `insert`, `delete` and `draw` to manage the tree.
