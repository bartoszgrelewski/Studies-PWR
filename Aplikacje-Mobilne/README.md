## 2. [**Lista 2**](https://github.com/bartoszgrelewski/Studies-PWR/tree/main/Aplikacje-Mobilne/Lista-2)  

### 2.1. Welcome to my **Hangman app!** As a student, I've developed this app using Java and Android Studio. The app displays a series of images of a  hangman and a word that the player must guess. The word is randomly selected from a dictionary stored in the strings.xml file. As the player guesses correctly, the app displays the correctly guessed letters in the word, so the player can track their progress. For example, if the word is "computer" and the player has guessed the letters "o", "m", and "e", the displayed word would look like "?om???e?". The images of the hangman are created using GIMP and are named appropriately (e.g., wisielec0.png, wisielec1.png, etc.). The images are displayed  using ImageView. Overall, this app is a fun way to test your vocabulary and guessing skills. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed creating it!   

### 2.2. This is a **classic Minesweeper game** implemented in Kotlin with a 9x9 grid of squares. At the beginning of the game, all squares are hidden, and the player must reveal them without detonating any mines. Each square displays the number of adjacent mines when revealed, and the player can flag squares they suspect contain mines. The game is won by revealing all squares and flagging all mines. The UI uses an appropriate layout that scales to different screen sizes, and the font size is adjusted accordingly.  

## 3. [**Lista 3**](https://github.com/bartoszgrelewski/Studies-PWR/tree/main/Aplikacje-Mobilne/Lista-3/CalendarApp)  

### This repository contains a fully functional **"Calendar"** application for Android. The app allows users to view and add events to the calendar, with the ability to delete events as well. The app utilizes RecyclerView and at least two activities with communication through intents. The app also remembers the calendar and event list. The app is designed with usability and convenience in mind. This app uses Applandeo library for calendar view.  
  
## 4. [**Lista 4**](https://github.com/bartoszgrelewski/Studies-PWR/tree/main/Aplikacje-Mobilne/Lista-4/TicTacToeGame)  

### This is a simple **Tic Tac Toe game** built using Jetpack Compose. The app allows the user to choose the size of the game board from 3x3 up to 20x20 and play against another user. The primary goal of this project is to showcase the use of Jetpack Compose for generating and managing UI elements from code, as well as utilizing the ViewModel to store and manage user interface data in a lifecycle-aware way.
