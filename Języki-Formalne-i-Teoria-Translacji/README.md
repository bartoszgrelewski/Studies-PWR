# This faculty is about formal languages and theory of translation.  

### Algorithms and Data Structures were implemented in C++:   
* `Lista 1` -  Algorithm for finding the longest common subsequence of two strings automata and Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm for finding the longest common prefix of two strings.  
* `Lista 2` -  Program in FLEX that reads a text file and deletes every whitespaces on the end and beginning of the line.  Output is a text file without whitespaces. It is simple lexer. There is also a program that implements postfix calculator using Flex and C++.  
* `Lista 3` - Using FLEX and BISON implement translator arithmetic expressions in body GF(1234577) from infix to postfix notation.
